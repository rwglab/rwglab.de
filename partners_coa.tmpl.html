            <p>
                Coalesenses is a young company providing <a href="http://www.coalesenses.com/index.php?page=solutions">solutions</a> for massively distributed systems with a focus on wireless sensor networks (WSNs).
            </p>

            <p>
                Wireless sensor networks consist of so called sensor nodes. They are tiny battery powered computers equipped with sensors and a wireless communication interface. Deployed in large numbers at places of interest, they form an ad hoc network and allow for a new perspective: taking the lab outside. Instead of taking the phenomenon into a laboratory with observation equipment, sensor networks observe it in situ. It is a shift in paradigm from a small number of solitary observers to observation quality through simple but highly redundant, cooperating sensors.

            <p>
                Coalesenses originates from a university background in this new application area and holds on to the concept of cooperation with public research facilities. Hence we have state-of-the-art research knowledge at our command. We employ PhDs, engineers and students to incorporate latest research results into your projects.
